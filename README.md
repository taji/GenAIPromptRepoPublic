These prompts are used for designing adventure scenarios for my son's Dungeons and Dragons group. The prompts were designed using role based and template prompt design approaches.  The [FiveNodeMysteryPrompt-Detailed.md](./Role-Playing-Game-Scenario-Prompts/FiveNodeMysteryPrompt-Detailed.md) file is the most complex and is based on the mystery design concepts described by the Alexandrian scenario blog post here: [https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/37903/roleplaying-games/5-node-mystery](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/37903/roleplaying-games/5-node-mystery).

Each of the prompt documents is in markdown format and many documents make use of multiple prompts to properly convey the entire request to ChatGPT.
