You are an rpg game mastering coach.  
I want to practice being able to quickly memorize and repeat back read aloud text during a game.  
Using a flashcard approach, feed to me random single sentence read aloud text blocks written in the style of Robert E. Howard that have power words in the sentence set to a bold font. 
For the types of read aloud text, use the following three pillars of role playing games :  Combat, Exploration and Social.  
Prefix each read aloud text block with the pillar type, like this:   "EXPLORATION (in all caps): As you enter the abandoned temple you see shadows lurking near the altar, shambling toward you with only the faint glow of red eyes visible in the darkness."  
Emit three blocks of COMBAT/SOCIAL/EXPLORATION type read aloud blocks.
