Guarding the Horcrux is an iron golem who is immune to magical spells.
Unbeknownst to the team, there is another team of wizards (led by Bellatrix Lestrange who is serving Threxulon the Mind Flayer) that will attempt to steal the horcrux at the same time.
As a lockdown contingency (and unknown to the player characters), there is a device known as the Dispelling Stone near the location of the Horcrux. If the Horcrux is moved, the device will nullify all magical spells in Malfoy Manor for the remainder of the scenario. This will force the player characters and their enemies to rely on their natural, non-magical abilities rather than magic for the remaining time of the heist. The only knowledge the player characters have of the Dispelling Stone is an overheard convesation describing the "Muggle Lockdown" contingency.
The Malfoy's are hosting a masked ball for their Death Eater allies at Malfoy Manor the night of the heist.  The purpose of the ball is to allow the Malfoys (and Voldemort) to uncover any traitors among the Death Eaters that are serving Thexulon. 
Everyone at the ball is wearing their fashionable Death Eater Masks, so there is an opportunity for the player characters to disguise themselves as Death Eaters.
For the traitors that are serving Threxulon, they each have a hidden tattoo on thier wrist that indicates their alligience to Threxulon (and their betrayal of Voldemort).  Malfoy has discovered a spell that will expose the tatoo on each Death Eater's wrist. He will cast the spell the ball to reveal the traitors.
